To create a heuristic, you want to first go to ReadSpecificMethods.java
1. You will notice an object HeuristicDatabase named h_d. Its constructor needs one argument: the total number of heuristics you are using.
2. Below that, you will notice calls to a method named addTransformer. It takes in one arguement: a BodyTransformer.
3. BodyTransformers are used in Soot to edit or modify methods that Soot acts on. You will have to create one.

Make a java file named 'Something'Heuristic.java.
1. First, make sure you extend the class the Heuristic base.
2. The constructor for the new Heuristic you created should have two arguments, one that takes in the HeuristicDatabase, and one that takes in an integer.
	The constructor should call its superconstructor using the same arguements. This connects the heuristic to the database and gives it an identification number.
3. Next, you want to make a protected void method called interalTransform. Just copy it from another existing heuristic.
4. The method MUST call HeuristicDatabase's name_heuristic method. The standard I have is to give it the heuristic id number and the phaseName as its name.
5. Now do whatever analysis you need. You can use the Body parameter to get information on the method. You should look at Soot's javadoc. You can find a link for it on the wiki.
	The link should be this: https://soot-build.cs.uni-paderborn.de/doc/soot/
	Classes you may want to note for analysis purposes: 'Body','BriefBlockGraph','BriefUnitGraph','Unit'
	Read the "readme.txt" in the main folder to learn about important changes to classes that may be helpful.
6. When you do you analysis, you have to tell the HeuristicDatabase that the heuristic made a prediction. You need to use the add method of the HeuristicDatabase. It takes in four arguements: a SootMethod, an integer (that is the id), a boolean representing untaken or taken (false and true respectively), and the IfStmt where the heuristic applied. Example method calls are below.
	hd.add(b.getMethod(),h_id,true,if_stmt); //The heuristic predicts taken for the if_stmt in question.
	hd.add(b.getMethod(),h_id,false,if_stmt); //The heuristic predicts untaken for the if_stmt in question.
	//To NOT make a prediction at all, you just never call the 'add' method. The HeuristicDatabase, by default, assumes all heuristics don't apply until you call 'add'.
7. If you need a specific example, check PointerHeuristic. It will be more heavily documented.

Add the Heuristic to Soot
1. When you have your new heuristic, you need to add it to ReadSpecificMethods.java
2. Increment the integer arguement constructor of HeuristicDatabase to increase its size.
3. Add another call to 'addTransformer'. The arguement of it should be the constructor to your new heuristic.
4. You should give it the HeuristicDatabase object and an unique id. Do not make the id larger or equal to the size of the heuristic database.
5. The next time you run the static data generator, the new heuristic should be used.
