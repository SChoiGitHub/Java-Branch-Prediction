The DataAggregator program is a c++ program. In order to compile it, you need to open a console here and type in 'make'. It may not work if you do not have g++ installed, so if you cannot use it, install g++. When you get DataAggregator compiled, you can run it with two arguements: the first one should be the filename of the static data file while the other should be the profile data file. The bash script is a convience script that does everything for you, assuming you have the static data and profile data files named properly.

To clean this folder, you can use 'make clean' to remove all '.o' and the DataAggregator program. This will keep all source code and any data files.
