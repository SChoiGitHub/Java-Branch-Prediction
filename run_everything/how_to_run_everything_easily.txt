As always, this may not work 100% of the time. There was a problem with mismatches in the pd and sd of a test file.

1. Open a terminal at this location.
2. Move the class file of the thing you want to analyze here.
3. Use export to set "$SOOT_ANALYZE_TARGET" to the class file.
	For example, if I want to analyze "LoopTest.class", I use "export SOOT_ANALYZE_TARGET=LoopTest" in the terminal. (Yes, exclude file extensions)
4. Set additional "-cp" items if needed using "$SOOT_ANALYZE_DEPENDENCIES"
	You can either use an absolute path or a relative path using "../(SomeLocationWhereDependenciesAre)"
5. If you want to analyze a specific method, you will need to edit the "loadme.txt" file.
	A reminder: The format for the file is "(Class Name)+(Method Name)". Putting a line that is "LoopTest+main" will tell Tamiflex to analyze LoopTest's main method.
	By default, you will analyze only the main method of the target class with the given commands.
	Add additional echo commands that append to "../loadme.txt" below the first echo command (use >> instead of > to append instead of overwriting).
6. Move the profile data file of the target class into this folder.
	A reminder: The name of the profile data should be "(Class Name)_pd". LoopTest.class would have a profile data file of "LoopTest_pd".
7. Add the following exports:
	$RT_JAR_LOCATION
	$JCE_JAR_LOCATION
8. Copy and paste the entire thing after this instruction.

echo "$SOOT_ANALYZE_TARGET+main" > ../loadme.txt
