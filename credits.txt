The soot-trunk in the libs folder has been modified. The originial can be found here: "https://sable.github.io/soot/"
my_custom_soot_src contains my modified version of the soot source code. Again, the original is found above.
statc_data_generator contains the program that deals with heuristics and where they apply
data_aggregator uses profile and static data to generate combined data alongside data about heuristics and how accurate they are
probability_calculator contains the program that calculates method frequencies
TamiFlexer contains bash scripts to run dacapo benchmarks with Soot
test_programs contains programs for case testing Soot
libs contains libraries used in this program.
	Dacapo is one of the main libraries
	Soot is another
run_everything has convience instructions


The following papers were read and used in the making of my parts of this program.
